  Info.Plist Sharper - Plist files native parser, written in plain C#
</h1>

<h4 align="center">A simple and powerful parser for .plist files<a href="http://electron.atom.io" target="_blank"></a>.</h4>


## How To Use

Clone and run it on visual studio project or built it from terminal with dotnet build.

Then you can simply move debug/release dll into your project references.

Maybe in the future I will make nuget package of it, but at this moment it is the only way, you can use it.

Plist files have three different types : 
* Auto
* Binary
* Xml

This library can parse all of them.

Main classes you will use are : PlistReader and PlistWriter

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/tornikegomareli/PlistSharper
```
